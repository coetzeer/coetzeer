My wife gives me a lift home from the Mater Hospital at about 12. My head is spinning with the things I want to do when I get home. However, I had not taking into account that there would be physical side affects from being blown up like a gross, pasty flesh balloon. One of them, apparently, is that when I walk longer than 100m I get hiccups. These are particularly joyful because whenever I hiccup, the knife wounds from the small angry doctor stretch uncomfortably. 

At home, I open my laptop, and powerup 2 servers in my homelab. The plan is simple:
