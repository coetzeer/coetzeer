Went to Amiga Ireland with my friend Dermot who writes practicalreason.net. Why would I go to Amiga Ireland when I don't own an Amiga? Well a couple of reasons.

One was definetly to connect with my friend who I don't see often as used to when we worked together in the same company. It was super to have the opportunity to get into some 'brandy swirling' type conversations about life, hobbies, art, games, people, work, and any other topics which might be floating in the air around us. I love the conversations that Dermot and I have. They are horizon broadening, in a relaxing and comfortable way.

Went out to dinner at an Indian restaurant called the Silver Oak, which was amazing. Had a lovely Lamb - the lamb was soft and the curry was hot and tastey. The naan bread with thin, had a crispy base and soft, butter top - some of the best naan I've ever eaten. All washed back with a couple of Cobra beers - I highly recommend it.

We met some folks
- Two nice guys from Hungary who live and work in London. One of the guys had a stack of Amigas in London and another stack back home in Hungary. He'd written a book about QBase when he was younger, and self published (printed a master copy, made photocopies, folded the paper himself, manually bound and distributed) and then advertised the book in local newsagents and computer stores. 
- A guy from the Czech republic who told us a story about how he'd cycled around Scotland for 5 weeks, and slept under the stars for a few nights untill the on-off rain in Scotland forced him into a tent. The reason for the trip was to 'clean his mind', and is an idea that I love. He said it worked well!
